# Creator_Recipe_Manager
 
The project implements a system that helps create recipes and make it possible to put changes into them.
In the first menu, the user can choose from 4 options:
 - Modify an existing recipe,
 - Add a new recipe,
 - View a list of recipes and them pick one and see ingridients and instructions to them,
 - Exit the program.
After selecting the option to change an existing recipe, a submenu is displayed what the user can make changes such as:
 - Change the name of a recipe,
 - Adding a new component,
 - Removal of an existing component,
 - Return to the main menu.
To add a new recipe, select "add a new recipe" from the main menu. The first value to enter will be Category = {1 = Appetizers, 2 = Main course, 3 = Desserts}.
After selecting the category, enter the name of the recipe.
You can start entering the ingredients of a given recipe one by one, confirming each with the enter character.
When adding ingridients is finished its time to set the instructions to the recipe.
After adding a recipe, the user is notified about it and a message is displayed whether the user wants to enter another recipe, if so, he must select the option -1, if not -2.
Thanks to the above-mentioned options and additional instructions, the user can easily navigate through the program.
Almost every user input is protected against mistake.
The program saves and reads the entered recipes, thanks to which, after starting the program, we have recipes from previous sessions.
